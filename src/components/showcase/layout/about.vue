        Layouts are the elements that wrap page content, like navigational bar,
        drawer, header or footer. Multiple pages can share the same Layout, which
        is one of the main reason for their existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can have multiple headers and/or footers.

        Use it wisely with Vue Router.
